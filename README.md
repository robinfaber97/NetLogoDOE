## Features

## Usage
Make a Python file (.py), copy the following code into it and then run it. This will launch the GUI and allow you to use all functionalities.
IMPORTANT: If your operating system is Linux, the Gui() call requires two parameters with your NetLogo version and location. 
The netlogo_version parameter has to be one of: '5', '6.0', '6.1', '6.2'.
The netlogo_home parameter needs to be a valid file path to wherever on your PC your NetLogo installation is located.

### Windows

from NetLogoDOE.NetLogoDOE import Gui
Gui()
```

### Linux
```
from NetLogoDOE.NetLogoDOE import Gui
Gui(netlogo_version=??, netlogo_home=path_to_your_netlogo_installation)
```
